### Problem 1

First we import and clean data from `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. We import the data, specify the variables' type, clean variable names, select the interested columns, and update `entry` to a logical variable.

```{r}
nyc_transit_df = read_csv('data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv', col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, 'YES' = TRUE, 'NO' = FALSE)
  )
dim(nyc_transit_df)
```

Now the resulting dataset has `r nrow(nyc_transit_df)` rows and `r ncol(nyc_transit_df)` columns.

These data are not tidy by now. For examples, there are too many variables regarding routes served. We should convert `route` variables from wide to long format.

There are `r nrow(distinct(select(nyc_transit_df, station_name,line)))` distinct stations.

`r nrow((distinct(select(filter(nyc_transit_df, ada == TRUE), station_name, line))))` stations are ADA compliant.

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is `r round(nrow(filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == 'NO' & entry == TRUE)) / nrow(filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == 'NO')),2)`

Last, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A train. We convert `route` to longer format and use `select` and `distinct` function to answer the questions.

```{r}
A_df =
  nyc_transit_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = 'route_number',
    values_to = 'route_name'
    ) %>% 
  filter(route_name == 'A')
```

`r nrow(distinct(select(A_df, station_name, line)))` distinct stations serve the A train. And of these stations that serve the A train, `r nrow(distinct(select(filter(A_df, ada == TRUE), station_name, line)))` are ADA compliant.


### Problem 2

First we import Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, specify the sheet, omit non-data entries using `range`, clean variable names, select dumpster-specific data using `drop_na`, and round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable using `as.integer`. Since we need to combine two datasets later, we add an additional variable to keep track of which Trash Wheel it is. Meanwhile, specify the `dumpster` variable type as double.

```{r}
mr_trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel('data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx', 
             range = "Mr. Trash Wheel!A2:N535") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(year) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),
    type = "Mr Trash Wheel",
    dumpster = as.double(dumpster)
  )
```

Then use a similar process to import Professor Trash Wheel dataset.

```{r}
pro_trash_wheel_df =
  read_excel('data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx',
             range = "Professor Trash Wheel!A2:N117") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),
    type = "Professor Trash Wheel"
  )
```

Now we combine the two datasets.

```{r}
combined_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df, pro_trash_wheel_df)
```

The combined dataset has `r nrow(combined_df)` rows and `r ncol(combined_df)` columns. The variables include dumpster number, time(month, year, and date), weight, volume, different kinds of trash and their amount, homes powered by trash-made electricity, and the type of Trash Wheel.

In all, there are `r nrow(filter(combined_df, type == "Mr Trash Wheel"))` Mr Trash Wheel dumpster and `r nrow(filter(combined_df, type == "Professor Trash Wheel"))` Professor Trash Wheel dumpster documented.
The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is `r sum(pull(filter(combined_df, type == "Professor Trash Wheel"), weight_tons))` tons. 
The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is `r sum(pull(filter(combined_df, type == "Mr Trash Wheel" & year == "2020"), sports_balls))`.
The total volume of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is `r sum(pull(filter(combined_df, type == "Professor Trash Wheel"), volume_cubic_yards))` yards, while by Mr. Trash Wheel, the total volume is `r sum(pull(filter(combined_df, type == "Mr Trash Wheel"), volume_cubic_yards))` yards.
Totally, the two Trash Wheels have powered `r round(sum(pull(combined_df, homes_powered)))` homes in Maryland with electricity.


# Problem 3

We first import data from `pols-month.csv`, break up the variable `mon` into `year`, `month`, and `day`; replace month number with month name; create a `president` variable taking values `gop` and `dem`, remove `prez_dem`, `prez_gop`, and `day` variable.

```{r}
pols_df = read_csv('data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv') %>% 
  separate(mon, sep = '-', into = c("year","month","day")) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = recode(month,
                   '01' = 'January',
                   '02' = 'February',
                   '03' = 'March',
                   '04' = 'April',
                   '05' = 'May',
                   '06' = 'June',
                   '07' = 'July',
                   '08' = 'August',
                   '09' = 'September',
                   '10' = 'October',
                   '11' = 'November',
                   '12' = 'December'),
    president = recode(prez_dem, `1` = "dem", `0` = "gop")
  ) %>% 
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop)
```

Second, we import and clean data from `snp.csv` using a similar process. We arrange according to year and month for consistency across datasets.

```{r}
snp_df = 
  read_csv('data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv') %>% 
  separate(date, sep = '/', into = c('month', 'day', 'year')) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    year = ifelse(year >= 50, year + 1900,
                  year + 2000)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = recode(month,
                   '1' = 'January',
                   '2' = 'February',
                   '3' = 'March',
                   '4' = 'April',
                   '5' = 'May',
                   '6' = 'June',
                   '7' = 'July',
                   '8' = 'August',
                   '9' = 'September',
                   '10' = 'October',
                   '11' = 'November',
                   '12' = 'December'),
  ) %>% 
  select(year, month, close)
```

Third, we tidy the unemployment data imported from `unemployment.csv`. We switch from wide to long format.

```{r}
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv('data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv') %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = 'month',
    values_to = 'unemployment_percentage'
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = recode(month,
                   'Jan' = 'January',
                   'Feb' = 'February',
                   'Mar' = 'March',
                   'Apr' = 'April',
                   'Jun' = 'June',
                   'Jul' = 'July',
                   'Aug' = 'August',
                   'Sep' = 'September',
                   'Oct' = 'October',
                   'Nov' = 'November',
                   'Dec' = 'December')
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Finally, we join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment into the result.

```{r}
merged_df = 
  merge(unemployment_df,
        merge(snp_df, pols_df))
```

The first dataset `pols_df` related to the number of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time, so it contained variables including the time, the number of governors, senators, and representatives who are democratic or republican, and whether the president was democratic or republican.


The second dataset `snp_df` related to a representative measure of stock market, so it contained variables including the time and the closing values of the S&P stock index on the associated date.


The third dataset `unemployment_df` related to unemployment rates, so it contained variables including the time and the percentage of unemployment on the associated date.


The resulting dataset has `r nrow(merged_df)` rows and `r ncol(merged_df)` columns. The range of years is `r max(pull(merged_df, year)) - min(pull(merged_df, year))`. The names of variables include the time(year and month), the percentage of unemployment, the closing values of the S&P stock index, the number of national politicians, and whether the president was democratic or republican. Since I used the `merge` function, the resulting dataset only kept the rows which the three datasets all have according to year and month.
